        "Transition Taskr was a project that myself and a team of 4 other Software Engineers created in order to allow our client to be able to keep track of two categories of users. I personally worked the most on handling the authorization and authentication of users and making sure the roles had the proper permissions. One problem I had to overcome was that we had to find a way to control how the different roles registered. The way I fixed this is by having the user pass in a passcode that is set up by the client. By inputing a role's passcode, the registration page would be for that role.",
